#using expressions with comparison operators#

*The operand dosnot have to be a single value or variable name .
An operend can be an expression (because each expression evaiuates into a single value)

ex:== is equal to(numbers,strings or booleans)to see they are the same

   != is not equal to(number,string or booleans)to see they arenot the same

    === is strict equal to check that thr both data type and value are the same

     !== is strict not equal to compares two value are not the same
      
      > to check if the number on the left is greater than the number of the right

      < to check that the number on the right is greated than the number on the left

       >= greater than or equal to

       <= less than or equal to

##logical operations##

&& : logical and to evaluate the true and then the expression returns the true

|| : logical or to test at least one condition

 ! : logical not to reverses the state of an expressions


###using swich statment###

*The porpuse of swich statment is to present the user with defferent message depending on which level they are at.
the message is stored in a variable called msg.*

####loops####

loops check a condition

**for:** if you need run code a specific number of time**
**while** if u dont know how many time the code should run**
**Do while** same of while loop but it will always run the statment inside the curely braces**
for example (var i =0; i<10; i++){
}


*The variable i : when the condition is no longer true , the loop ends . the script moves to the next line of code.*
