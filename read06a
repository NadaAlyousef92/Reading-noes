#What is afunction?#

*function let you group a series of statements togather to perform a specific task. 
if different parts of a script repeat the same task you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)*
A variant of the Function.prototype.call method, taking all arguments of the method to be invoked as a single array argument, is Function.prototype.apply.

**JavaScript allows us to write our own functions as well. This section explains how to write your own functions in JavaScript.**

##Function Definition##

Before we use a function, we need to define it. 
The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

###Calling a Function###

To invoke a function somewhere later in the script, you would simply need to write the name of that function as shown in the following code.

####Function Parameters#

 we have seen functions without parameters. But there is a facility to pass different parameters while calling a function. These passed parameters can be captured inside the function and any manipulation can be done over those parameters. A function can take multiple parameters separated by comma.

#####The return Statement#####
A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last statement in a function.

For example, you can pass two numbers in a function and then you can expect the function to return their multiplication in your calling program
